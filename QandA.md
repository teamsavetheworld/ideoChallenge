# Full description

B&M ltd is working to create a collaborative online platform called RootFinder. This platform is specifically designed to facilitate global problem solving and community bridge building. By taking existing ideas already used by the software industry, and re-engineering them for humanitarian work, we hope to provide a way for communities across the world to build bridges between themselves. We are seeking this funding in order to create the scaffolding to enable effective collaboration to solve the biggest problems facing the world. 

# Explain your idea

We will adapt the technology that facilitates the development of many open source projects. The tool we are proposing will take inspiration and technical solutions from a number of areas:

 - Wikis, a website or database developed collaboratively by a community of users, allowing any user to add and edit content.
 - Git, a version control system designed to be quick, simple, allow non-linear development, be fully distributed and handle large projects efficiently
 - Interactive notebooks, a browser based tool that can combine code execution, rich text, mathematics, plots, interactive visualisations and other rich media.
 
We will use the underlying data structures from Git and develop a user interface that allows collaboration between those with technical and non-technical backgrounds, using collaboration management ideas lifted from Wikipedia and other wiki platforms. We will use interactive notebooks such as Jupyter to facilitate the production of reproducible analysis and simulations.

The platform is not a traditional solution, but instead a way of dealing with one of the largest problems in social change – communication and organisation. Dealing with the world’s largest issues requires a variety of things, many of which already exist. There exists a variety of funding solutions, ranging from government aid to private donors. There is also a large number of people who want to help, as evidence by the huge pool of applicants for most NGO and charity jobs. What is lacking is a way of co-ordinating all of these existing aspects of social change.

We want the platform to be able to bring all these pre-existing elements together. Historically, effective communication and collaboration allow for better solutions. By building the tool that will bring all of the elements together and ensuring they synthesise, we can facilitate the solving of social problems that currently remain out of our grasp.

The platform will have applications for a wide variety of challenges that have a technical component that requires data analysis, simulation or other specialised problem-solving techniques. We will not limit the use of the platform to a specific cause, but instead, by working with NGOs and other organisations, focus the effort of the platform’s community to solve problems in areas that they can have maximum impact in. We have identified a number of major global challenges that could be the initial area of focus these include: 
 - Water Availability in countries that are likely to experience shortages in the next 20 years,  
 - Agriculture Resilience as global temperatures increase
 - Energy Generation in post fossil fuel world
 
# Who Benefits?
## Who are your beneficiaries? How will they benefit from your idea?

Four main targets

Existing groups/ programs: These groups are often highly knowledgeable about their specific areas but often operate in information silos. By targeting these groups and encouraging them to share their information we hope to break down many of the traditional barriers that exist in both industry and the NGO/non-profit world. 

Stakeholders: We are specifically aiming the platform at those who are affected by the problems in the world and who want to collaborate with those who wish to help. This would ensure that the platform would incorporate those who are best placed to explain what solutions are required. 

Motivated individuals who are inspired to create social good in the world: We have identified that it is often difficult to find employment that both makes a social impact while remaining intellectually stimulating. These people are often recruited directly into fields that are not commonly associated with social change – for example professional services, Finance, oil & gas etc. We hope to provide them with an outlet for their desire to change the world while retaining employment in other fields. Engaging with people who are working inside of other companies will help us expand our influence into these organisations.

Fundraisers: Donors are often far removed from the projects they fund. While philanthropists, governments or large benefactors can impose rigorous funding criteria, they are somewhat reliant on the organisations they fund. By incorporating funders within the system, they would be able observe the process of finding solutions, and fund them appropriately. This would also allow platform users to directly respond to donors concerns and adapt the solution to deal with either expanding or contracting financial aid. This system would also deal with many of the transparency requirements many large donors now require. 

 
# How is your idea unique?
## What are you doing that is different from similar initiatives? What unique advantages do you have to implement this idea? Think about how another organization is addressing the idea - how they are doing it and why do you believe yours will be more successful?

One of the major impacts of the internet has been the creation of communities which bridge geographical and social barriers. These communities have originated around common interests or a common purpose. The platform we are building will facilitate the creation of a community that will help solve social and economic challenges. 

Similar platforms, such as github and kaggle, have been developed to enable collaborative problem solving in specific domains such as software development or data science. We see this, not as a threat, but as a helpful first step towards our goal of linking together people of varying disciplines. 

Our focus is on building the infrastructure for motivated individuals to contribute through their technical ability to social challenges  that can be address using science and engineering. Instead of addressing a specific problem we are hoping to address hundreds of different issues by connecting thousands of people with the right skills and abilities who share common goals.

One key difference between us and other similar endeavours is that we will engage people who are already working in areas such as engineering, IT and finance. These people have existing knowledge and competencies in their respective fields and can use them to help solve the problems we hope to tackle. The model of engaging with companies and their employees has been incredibly successful in helping to change corporate culture and perception, for example in LGBTQ rights and female empowerment. With our platform we hope to do a similar thing, but instead provide a unique tool to allow people to contribute to some of the world’s leading problems. 
 
# Idea Proposal Stage
## We are excited to learn about ideas at diverse stages of development. At what stage would you currently classify your idea as?

Research & Early Testing: I am exploring my idea, gathering the inspiration and information I need to test it with real users.

# Tell us more about you
## Are you an individual? Organization? Business? Looking for a collaborator?

## We'd love to know about who you're working with and where you are based! Who will be able to devote time to make this idea a reality? If this is a partnership, what role will each partner play?
 
B & M limited was set up as a way to gather together like-minded people who want to help change the world. We are all currently London based professionals working in a wide range of industries, who in our spare time are trying to figure out how we can use the skills developed in industry to help benefit the world; B & M is the culmination of that.

In our group currently there is;

 - A project manager at a world renowned IT services corporation who has also worked in engineering;
 - Consultant at a leading engineering consultancy firm with a background in applied mathematics;
 - A data scientist at a technology startup;

We are pursuing this project alongside our professional commitments, but hope to be able to use this funding as a way of developing our idea. In the spirit of rootfinder, we plan to continue to work on the project part time while bringing in new partners to deal with problems as they occur. In doing so, we believe this will harmonize with the stated ideas of our platform by ensuring that it is built with the part-time professional in mind.
