# Full description

B&M Technologies ltd is working to create a collaborative online platform called RootFinder. This platform is specifically designed to facilitate global problem solving and community bridge building. By taking pre-existing organisational systems already used by the software industry, and re-engineering them for humanitarian work, we hope to provide a way for communities, individuals, the private sector, NGOs and donors across the world to build bridges between one another. We are seeking this funding in order to create what we believe is a fundamental pre-requisite to solving the planet’s problems: the scaffolding that will enable the collaboration that results in effective solutions to the world’s issues.  

# Explain your idea

We will adapt technology that supports the development of many open source projects. RootFinder will take inspiration and technical solutions from a number of concepts and similar platforms:

 - Wikis, a website or database developed collaboratively by a community of users, allowing any user to add and edit content;
 - Git, a version control system designed to be quick, simple, allow non-linear development, be fully distributed and handle large projects efficiently;
 - Interactive notebooks, a browser-based tool that can combine code execution, rich text, mathematics, plots, interactive visualisations and other diverse media.

We will use the underlying data structures from Git and develop a user interface that allows collaboration between those with technical and non-technical backgrounds, using collaboration management ideas from Wikipedia and other wiki platforms. We will use interactive notebooks such as Jupyter to facilitate the production of reproducible analysis and simulations.

RootFinder will help to solve humanitarian challenges by addressing one of the biggest issues  faced by those who strive for social change – communication and organisation. Many of the elements to address global issues already exist.  These include a variety of funding solutions, ranging from government aid to private donors, and many people who want to help, as the huge pool of applicants for NGO and charity jobs indicates. What is lacking is a way of co-ordinating all of these existing aspects of social change.

RootFinder will bring these pre-existing elements together. Historically, effective communication and collaboration allow for better solutions. By building the tool that will make this happen and ensuring succesful synthesise, we can facilitate the solving of social problems that currently remain out of our grasp.

RootFinder will have applications for a wide variety of challenges that have a technical component requiring data analysis, simulation or other specialised problem-solving techniques. We will not limit the use of the platform to a specific cause, but instead, by working with NGOs and other organisations, focus the  platform’s community to solve problems in areas where they can have maximum impact. We have identified a number of major global challenges that could be the initial area of focus. These include:

 - Water availability in countries that are likely to experience shortages in the next 20 years,
 - Agricultural resilience as global temperatures increase
 - Energy generation in a post-fossil fuel world

# Who Benefits?
## Who are your beneficiaries? How will they benefit from your idea?

- Stakeholders: RootFinder is specifically aimed at those who are affected by the problems in the world and who want to collaborate with those who can help. By working with NGOs and government organisations we can focus the community towards developing the solutions that are required.
 
- Motivated individuals: It is often difficult to find employment that makes a social impact while also utilising technical skills and abilities. People with these skills are often recruited to fields such as engineering, finance and digital services. RootFinder will provide an outlet for such people to use their knowledge and competencies to contribute to the social good. They will be able to do this while being remaining employed in their technical fields, allowing them to both continue to grow their skills and to potentially involve their companies.
 
- Fundraisers: By incorporating funders within the system, they would be able observe the process of finding solutions, and fund them appropriately.
 
# How is your idea unique?
## What are you doing that is different from similar initiatives? What unique advantages do you have to implement this idea? Think about how another organization is addressing the idea - how they are doing it and why do you believe yours will be more successful?

One of the major impacts of the internet has been the creation of communities which bridge geographical and social barriers. These communities have originated around common interests or a common purpose. RootFinder will facilitate the development of a community that will help solve social and economic challenges. Instead of addressing a specific problem we are hoping to address hundreds of different issues by connecting thousands of people with the right skills and abilities who share common goals. To our knowledge no other holistic problem solving initiative like this currently exists. 
 
# Idea Proposal Stage
## We are excited to learn about ideas at diverse stages of development. At what stage would you currently classify your idea as?

Research & Early Testing: I am exploring my idea, gathering the inspiration and information I need to test it with real users.

## We'd love to know about who you're working with and where you are based! Who will be able to devote time to make this idea a reality? If this is a partnership, what role will each partner play?
 
B&M Technologies ltd  was set up to bring together like-minded people who want to help change the world. We are all currently London-based professionals working in a wide range of industries, who in our spare time are trying to figure out how we can use the skills developed in industry to help benefit the world; B&M Technologies ltd is the culmination of that.

In our group currently there is;

- A project manager at a world renowned IT services corporation who has also worked in engineering;
- A Consultant at a leading engineering consultancy firm with a background in applied mathematics;
- A data scientist at a technology startup;

We are pursuing this project alongside our professional commitments, but hope to be able to use this funding as a way to fund the project. In the spirit of RootFinder, we plan to continue to work on the project part-time while bringing in new partners to deal with development problems as they emerge. In doing so, we believe this will harmonize with the stated ideas of RootFinder by ensuring that it is built with the part-time professional in mind.
